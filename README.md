## Why did I make this?

I really like to watch and read various forms of media. However, most web browsers have a TON of clutter surrounding the webpage I want to use. With desktop browsers, you can go full screen and not have to worry. However, mobile browsers don't have that luxury for all websites.

Some browsers don't even allow you to hide the URL bar!

Asobi removes all of this clutter by giving you a WebView with a minimalist navigation bar (and swipe gestures). By doing these things, you can have a distraction free browsing experience.

## Why not use Safari web clips?

Well, safari web clips are great. They can easily save/load PWAs in an immersive feeling. However, these snippets don't allow for image saving, proper navigation, and sometimes are annoying to fiddle around with.

## Initial Setup

When you open the app for the first time, you will see DuckDuckGo (or whatever the fallback webpage to load is). This is because you haven't set a default URL to navigate to on app load!

To set a default URL:

1. Open settings
2. Scroll to the bottom option that says `Default URL`
3. Enter your favorite URL in the textbox and the site should load immediately, when you press the home button, or when you close/reopen the app

## Planned features

Here are features that I have planned for future releases (these are also in the issues)

- RPC on mac: Used for Discord to show that you're using Asobi
